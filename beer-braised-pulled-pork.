## Ingredients
* Pork Shoulder
* 24oz of Tankhouse beer
* 3 cloves of garlic
* Juice of 1 lime
* Juice of 1 oranage
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp ginger
* Salt & pepper


# Directions
* Get pork trimmed/cleaned up to your liking and give a nice rubdown with spices. 
* Once rubbed, fire up a dutch oven over a med-high flame and put in some canola or veggie oil. Once hot, sear the pork on all sides until nice and brown all over. 
* Preheat oven to 350F.
* Remove dutch oven from heat and make it rain on your pork: throw in garlic, lime juice, orange juice, two bottles of tankhouse, a few extra dashes of your spices and just a topping-off of water if there isn't enough liquid. You want the pork covered as much as possible without going too high in the pot.
* Cover the pot with foil, top it off with the lid, then toss in the oven at 350F. In 45 min or so you can cut the heat to 300F and just let it go for 4-6 hours. Don't be afraid to pull it out, roll a foil corner and poke with a fork to gauge tenderness. The longer it cooks the better, obviously!
* Once your pork is done, remove from pot and let cool slightly on a tray, then go in with gloved hands or two forks and shred up a storm! Once pulled, pour some of that amazing braising liquid into the pork and mix it all up.
