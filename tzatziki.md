## Ingredients
* 1 cucumber, seeded and diced
* 1 tsp Himalayan salt
* 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
* the zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 tsp Himalayan salt
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped
* 2 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp dried oregano or za'atar

# Directions
* Peel the cucumbers and remove the seeds by halving them lengthwise and running a spoon down the middle to scoop out the seeds. Slice in half lengthwise again, then dice into Â¼ inch cubes.
* Place the chopped cucumber in a fine sieve and sprinkle with salt. Top with a small plate and add some weight, such as a large can, over that plate. Leave that to drain for about 30 minutes.
* In a mixing bowl, combine yogurt, lemon zest and juice, garlic, black pepper, salt, parsley, mint and oregano or za'atar and stir to combine.
* Add the cucumber to the yogurt mixture and again, stir to combine.
* Cover and refrigerate for about an hour before serving to allow the flavors to fully develop.
