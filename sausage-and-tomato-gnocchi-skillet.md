## Ingredients
* 1 pound gnocchi
* Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 4 links cooked sausage, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick coins
* 1.5 pints cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise
* 1 to 2 ounces fresh basil, julienned (1/2 to 1 cup loosely packed)

# Directions
* Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling; cook the gnocchi for 2 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil.
* Heat a 10-inch or larger cast iron skillet over medium heat with a light drizzle of olive oil. Add the sausage and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it begins to brown. Push the sausage into a pile at the edge of the skillet and turn the heat up to high.
* When the skillet is quite hot, add the tomatoes, skin down, crowding them in if necessary. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until they are blistered, then stir in with the sausage. Cook for 2 more minutes, until both tomatoes and sausage are slightly browned. Stir in gnocchi and cook just until all is combined, but the tomatoes have not broken down into sauce.
* Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
