## Ingredients
* 2 cups diced peeled potatoes
* 1-3/4 cups sliced carrots
* 1 cup butter, cubed
* 2/3 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1-3/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 3/4 teaspoon pepper
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 1-1/2 cups milk
* 4 cups cubed cooked chicken
* 1 cup frozen peas
* 1 cup frozen corn
* 2 packages (14.1 ounces each) refrigerated pie pastry

# Directions
* Preheat oven to 425Â°. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender; drain.
* In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato mixture; remove from heat.
* Unroll a pastry sheet into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim even with rims. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining pastry; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.
* Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting. Yield: 2 potpies (8 servings each).
