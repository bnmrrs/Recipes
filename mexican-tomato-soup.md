## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1 small bunch of green onions 
* 1 bunch of fresh cilantro 
* 4 garlic cloves 
* 1/2 cup basmati rice 
* 450g jarred red peppers 
* 28oz can of diced tomatoes 
* 1 cup 0% plain greek yogurt 
* 2 tsp pickled jalapeno chilies 
* 2 limes 
* 1 cup cherry tomatoes 
* 1 ripe avocado 
* 1/4 cup feta cheese

# Directions
* Trim and finely slice the green onions.  Reserve some for garnish and put the rest into a pan on high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil.
* Add in the cilantro stalks (reserving the leaves).  
* Mince the garlic and add to the pan with the rice, drained jarred peppers, and the canned tomatoes.  
* Pour in 850 ml of boiling water, add a pinch of salt and cover with the lid.  
* Half the tomatoes, and slice the avocado, and place them along with the feta, reserved green onions, cilantro leaves, and lime slices onto a serving board. 
* In a bowl, use an immersion blender to mix the yogurt and the jalapenos along with a splash of their pickling vinegar (crucial, it's so good!).  Then use the immersion blender in the soup until the texture is smooth.  
* Add in the juice of 1/2 a lime, and season to taste.  
* Serve in bowls, and let everyone add their own sauce and toppings.
