## Ingredients
* 3-4 cloves minced garlic
* 1 cup honey
* 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium soy sauce is best)
* 1 tsp ground black pepper

# Directions
* In a medium saucepan add the 2 tbsp olive oil and minced garlic. Cook over medium heat to soften the garlic but do not let it brown.
* Add the honey, soy sauce and black pepper.
* Simmer together for 5-10 minutes, remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Watch this carefully as it simmers because it can foam up over the pot very easily.
