## Ingredients
* One 3-3 1/2- pound chicken
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Few handfuls of tiny potatoes
* Few handfuls of chopped carrots
* Olive oil, for potatoes
* Juice of 1 lemon

# Directions
* Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Cut the backbone out of the chicken using a pair of sharp kitchen shears, then flatten the breast by cutting through the cartilage.
* Generously season the cavity with salt and pepper, then transfer the chicken to a roasting pan or 12-inch cast iron skillet (recommended), laying the chicken breast side-up.  
* Gently pat the skin dry with a paper towel, then generously season the skin with more salt and pepper.  
* Toss the potatoes with the olive oil, salt, and pepper, then arrange them around the chicken in the skillet.
* Roast the chicken 30 to 45 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the the thigh reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir the potatoes after about 20 minutes, so they cook evenly.  
* Remove the skillet from the oven, and sprinkle with the thyme and drizzle with the lemon juice.  Allow the chicken to rest at room temperature 10-15 minutes before carving and serving.
