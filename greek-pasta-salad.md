## Pasta Salad Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups uncooked pasta, such as penne or rotini
* 2/3 cup sliced red onions
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 cup diced cucumbers
* 3/4 cup diced green peppers
* 1 cup crumbled feta cheese

## Vinaigrette Ingredients
* 1/3 cup red wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

# Directions
* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it until al dente. Strain the pasta and transfer it to a large bowl to cool slightly. While the pasta cools, make the dressing.
* In a small bowl, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients, except for the olive oil. While whisking, stream in the olive oil. Season the dressing with salt and pepper, to taste.
* Add the red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, green peppers and feta cheese to the bowl with the pasta.
* Pour the dressing over the pasta, tossing to combine, then cover the salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. When ready to serve, toss the pasta salad again and enjoy cold or at room temperature.
