## Ingredients
* 1 quart can whole peeled san marzano tomatoes
* 1 pint pureed san marzano tomatoes (optional)
* 1 jar/4-6 whole roasted sweet red bell peppers
* 10-15 cloves fresh sliced garlic
* 1.5 whole yellow onions, julienned
* 3-4 large eggs
* 2 tsp smoked spanish paprika
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp fresh cracked black pepper
* 1 tsp sugar (optional)
* 1 cup olive oil
* 6-8 slices of crusty bread, brushed with olive oil

Preheat oven to 450º
* Prep chop your onions, garlic and red peppers.  
* Sauté the onions and sliced garlic in olive oil on medium high heat until translucent (5-7 minutes).
* Add your spices and “bloom” them out (sauté until you start to smell them)
* Add your can of tomatoes. Break them up a bit with a metal spoon, then add roasted red peppers to the party.
* Add bay leaves and season to taste with salt and pepper
* Turn heat down to low and simmer for 25-30 minutes. Adjust seasoning if needed.
* Place about 2 cups of the finished product in an oven-proof cast iron pan (a small paella pan works great)
* Make resting places for your eggs with a spoon and crack one egg into each of those spots.(crack into a bowl first to help with pouring and to avoid the risk of a cracked shell falling into the stew)
* Bake for 7-10 minutes, until the egg whites begin to set, but the yolk remains runny.
* Slice and grill bread and serve with dish.
