http://chelseawinter.co.nz/easy-thai-chicken-curry-recipe/

## Ingredients
### Curry paste
* 2 tbsp Thai green curry paste (the best quality you can find)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 shallots (or ½ a large onion), roughly chopped
* 1 bunch fresh coriander (including stalks), washed
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 3 big green chillies*

### Curry
* 1 tbsp peanut oil (or rice bran or canola)
* 500-600g boneless chicken thighs, chopped
* 400-500ml coconut cream (pick one with no preservatives – I prefer the brand ‘Kara’)
* 500ml reduced salt chicken stock
* 1 kaffir lime leaf (or use the zest of 2 limes)
* Vegetables of your choice – green beans, snow peas, capsicum, cherry tomatoes, baby corn, carrot, tinned bamboo, spinach, eggplant, mushrooms
* 1 tbsp palm sugar (or use brown sugar)
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* Big handful basil leaves (Thai or regular)

# Directions
* In a processor, mortar & pestle or stick wand blender, mix the curry paste, garlic, shallots, coriander, cumin, ground coriander and chillies to make smooth thick paste with 1/2 cup of the coconut cream (this will help it come together). If you don’t have a mortar & pestle or food processor, just to chop/mince the ingredients until as ‘mushy’ as possible then add the coconut cream.
* Heat the oil a heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste mixture and cook for 4-5 minutes to release the aromas, stirring continuously (you should see little beads of oil come to the top by the end). Add stock, kaffir lime leaf or zest, the remaining coconut cream, and simmer gently for around 10 minutes. Add the chicken and simmer for another 10 minutes until just cooked through and the sauce has reduced and thickened. Add the vegetables and simmer for a few more minutes until only just tender.
* Now add the brown sugar, lime juice and fish sauce. Stir to combine and taste it – then, add more sour, sweet or salty until it tastes perfect to you. If you like it hot, you can throw in some chilli flakes or chopped red chillies.  Lastly stir through the basil leaves.
* Serve with rice and pile up with loads of coriander or basil, peanuts and chillies.
