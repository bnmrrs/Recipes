# Beef Stew
http://chefmichaelsmith.com/recipe/beef-stew/#.UofK35SxNXc

## Ingredients
* 2.5 pounds of stewing beef
* vegetable oil
* 5 carrots
* 4 celery stalks
* 4 potatoes
* 2 onions
* 28 oz can of diced tomatoes
* 1/2 bottle of red wine
* 4 cups of beef broth
* A few bay leaves
* Frozen peas

# Directions
* Preheat a large thick-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. 
* Meanwhile, pat the beef dry with a clean towel and then cut it into large cubes and season it with the salt and pepper. 
* Add a splash of oil to the pot—enough to cover the bottom in a thin layer—and toss in enough meat to form a single sizzling layer. Sear the meat on every side until it’s evenly browned. 
* Be patient when you’re browning the meat; it takes a little time but it’s worth every minute. The caramelized flavours are the secret to a rich hearty stew. As the meat browns, remove it from the pan, adding more oil and meat as needed. 
* Once the meat is done, discard the remaining oil but keep all the browned bits in the pan; they’ll add lots of flavour to the stew. 
* Add half of the vegetables—reserving the other half—and all the meat back to the pot. Add the tomatoes and enough wine and beef broth to barely cover the works. Add the bay leaves and rosemary and bring the pot to a simmer. 
* Continue cooking until the meat is almost tender, about 1 hour, then add the remaining vegetables, the baby onions and the frozen peas. Adding the vegetables in 2 batches allows the first batch to dissolve into the stew while the second retains its shape, colour and texture. Continue simmering until the meat and veggies are tender, another 30 minutes or so. When the stew is tender, taste it and season as you like.
