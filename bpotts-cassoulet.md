## Ingredients
* 1 package Hot Italian Sausages (4-pack)
* 1 yellow onion - roughly chopped
* 1 clove garlic - smashed
* 1 can mixed beans - drained and rinsed
* 1 can diced tomatoes - drained and rinsed
* 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce - finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar
* 1 crusty roll
* salt and pepper
* olive oil

## Directions
* Place a large frying pan on the stove and set on medium heat. Once the pot is heated, add some olive oil, then the onion and garlic.
* Place the sausages in the pan with the onions and garlic.
* Stirr occasionally until both the onions and the sausage are slightly browned.
* Add in the beans and the tomatoes, the oregano and the sugar.
* Add in the chipotle pepper with some of the adobo sauce it comes in - more if you like the heat!
* Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let simmer for 30-45 minutes until thickened.
* Season with salt and pepper.

Serve over the crusty roll and garnish with some cilantro.
