http://www.food.com/recipe/betty-crockers-classic-bread-turkey-stuffing-44938

## Ingredients
* 12 cups bread, cubes (Mom makes her own sometimes)
* 1 cup unsalted butter
* 3⁄4 cup minced onion
* 1 1⁄2 cups chopped celery, stalks and leaves
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* 1 tablespoon ground sage
* no-salt-added chicken broth (optional)

# Directions
* In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat melt the butter, then sauté the onion and celery (and mushroom, if using) until the onion is soft, stirring occasionally.
* Stir in the salt, pepper, and sage and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
* Place the bread cubes into a large, deep bowl.
* Pour 1/4 cup of the butter/celery mixture over the cubes and toss well, then repeat steps until all of the butter mixture is used.
* Toss the cubes thoroughly to coat.
* (Regarding the optional chicken broth: for dry stuffing, add little or no liquid; for moist stuffing mix in lightly with fork just enough chicken broth to moisten dry crumbs.) Let cool and use as stuffing for the turkey.
* We've made this stuffing in the crockpot, as well, adding the chicken broth for moistness.
