## Ingredients
* 1½ pounds Brussels sprouts
* 2-3 tablespoons melted butter
* Kosher salt and pepper
* 4 bacon slices, diced
* Aged balsamic vinegar

# Directions
* Preheat your oven to 400°F. Trim the ends and any old outer leaves from the Brussels sprouts.
* Cut sprouts in half and toss them with melted butter, salt, and pepper. 
* Dump them on a foil lined baking sheet, making sure to keep everything in one layer. Sprinkle the diced bacon over everything and throw them in the oven.
* The sprouts take about 30 to 35 minutes to roast, so set your timer for 10 minute intervals to regularly rotate and flip the sprouts ‘n swine.
* Check for seasoning and drizzle some of the aged balsamic vinegar on the finished dish.
