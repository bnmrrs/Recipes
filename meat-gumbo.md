## Ingredients
* 8 chicken thighs, skin on
* Salt and pepper
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* olive oil
* 400g chorizo, thickly sliced
* 4 rashers smoked streaky bacon, roughly chopped
* 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 green pepper, deseeded and chopped
* 1 yellow pepper, deseeded and chopped
* 4 celery sticks, finely chopped
* 3 tbsp. plain flour
* 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 kg sweet potato, peeled and roughly chopped
* 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
* 4 fresh bay leaves
* 1.5L chicken stock
* Small bunch of parsley
* 4 spring onions, finely chopped

# Directions
* Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and spices.
* Put a large saucepan on a high heat, add a little oil and fry the chicken, chorizo and bacon for approximately 15 minutes until golden and crispy. Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat from the pan and set aside.
* Turn down the heat and add the onion, peppers and celery to the pan. Cook gently for about 10 minutes until soft then stir in the flour to make the roux. Cook very gently, stirring constantly until the roux gets nice and dark and the flour has been cooked out; this can take between 10 â€“ 30 minutes depending on how brown you want the roux to be. Peanut butter colour is a good starting point!
* Add the garlic, sweet potato, browned meats, thyme and bay leaves to the pan and cook for a further minute. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil then turn down the heat and allow to simmer for 45 minutes or until the chicken is tender and falls off the bone.
* Once cooked, scoop the chicken out of the pan and shred the meat off the bone. Discard the skin and bones and return the meat to the pan.
* To serve, roughly chop some parsley and stir into the gumbo. Throw in a bit of cooked rice and scatter sliced spring onions over the gumbo. Enjoy!!
