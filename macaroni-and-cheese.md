## Ingredients
* 2 Tbsp of butter
* 3 clove of garlic, minced
* 1/3 cup of flour
* 2 cups milk (2%)
* 1 can evaporated milk
* 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp hot sauce
* 500 grams shredded old fort cheddar cheese
* 800 grams elbow macaroni
* 1 head cauliflower, broken into small pieces

# Directions
* Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. 
* In another large pot, melt the butter and quickly cook the garlic until you can smell it but not letting it brown. Add the flour and whisk until it comes together. Whisk in the milks and cook until the “sauce” thickens.
* Add the pasta to the water and cook for 6 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook the pasta for another 3 minutes, until the pasta is how you like it and the cauliflower is cooked through. Continue with your sauce.
* Whisk in the mustard, paprika and salt and pepper. Sprinkle in the cheese and whisk until melted.
* Drain the cooked pasta and cauliflower and pour it into the sauce pot.
