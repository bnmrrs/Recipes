## Ingredients
* 1 (5-pound) standing rib roast, trimmed $
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 5 garlic cloves
* 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
* 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* Cooking spray
* 1 1/2 cups fat-free, lower-sodium beef broth $

# Directions
* Let beef stand 1 hour at room temperature. Sprinkle beef evenly with salt and pepper.

* Place garlic in a mini chopper, and pulse until finely chopped. Add Dijon, thyme, rosemary, and oil; pulse to combine. Rub Dijon mixture evenly over beef. Place roast on the rack of a roasting pan coated with cooking spray; place rack in pan. Bake at 400° for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350° (do not remove roast from oven); bake at 350° for 30 minutes. Add broth to pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until a thermometer registers 135° or until desired degree of doneness. Remove roast from oven, and let stand 20 minutes before slicing.
