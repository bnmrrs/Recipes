## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup (1 stick or 113 grams) butter 
* 3/4 cup (150 grams) brown sugar, packed 
* 2 large eggs 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
* 3 large ripe bananas, mashed 
* 2 cups all-purpose flour 
* 1 teaspoon baking soda 
* 1 teaspoon baking powder 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 cup (118 ml) milk 
* 1/2 cup (150 grams) nutella
* 1 cup chocolate chips

# Directions
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
* In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well between additions. Beat in the vanilla extract and mashed bananas until fully incorporated. Mix in the flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the milk. Stir in the chocolate chips. Set aside.
* In a small microwave-safe bowl, place the Nutella and heat for 15 seconds until lightly warmed and melted. Be careful, though; if the Nutella gets too warm it will seize up into a solid so less time in the microwave is better.
* In the loaf pan, transfer 1/3 of the bread batter. Drizzle 1/3 of Nutella over the top and, using a butter knife, lightly swirl into the batter. Complete this step two more times, creating three layers. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool loaf in pan for 10 minutes before removing and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.
