# Pasta dough

## Ingredients
* 1 1/4 cup flour
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup hot water
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

# Directions
* Mix flour with salt.
* Stir water with egg until well mixed.
* In a bowl, combine flour and egg-water mixture together and mix until well incorporated. 
* Knead the dough until well-textured and firm.  The dough should not be too wet or too sticky.  It should only stick to itself, but not to your hands.  However, it should not be too dry,  either.
* Make the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap.    Let the dough stand for 1 hour at room temperature before using.  This allows gluten to work.
