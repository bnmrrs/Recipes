## Ingredients
* 2 medium ripe bananas, (the riper the better) sliced into 1/2" pieces
* 1 1/2 cup blueberries
* 1/4 cup honey (or agave)
* 1 cup uncooked quick oats
* 1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* pinch of salt
* 1 cup fat free milk (or any milk you desire)
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

# Directions
* Preheat the oven to 375Â° F.  Lightly spray a 8 x 8" or 9 x 9" ceramic baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
* Arrange the banana slices in a single layer on the bottom of the ceramic dish. Sprinkle half of the blueberries over the bananas, 1/4 tsp of the cinnamon, 1 tbsp of the honey and cover with foil. Bake 15 minutes, until the bananas get soft. 
* Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the oats, half of nuts, baking powder, remaining cinnamon, and salt; stir together.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining honey, milk, egg, and vanilla extract.
* Remove the bananas from the oven, then pour the oat mixture over the bananas and blueberries. 
* Pour the milk mixture over the oats, making sure to distribute the mixture as evenly as possible over the oats.  Sprinkle the remaining blueberries and walnuts over the the top.
* Bake the oatmeal for about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the oatmeal has set. Serve warm from the oven.
