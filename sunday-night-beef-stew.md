## Ingredients
* 3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
* 1 Tablespoon Butter
* 2 pounds Beef Stew Meat (chuck Roast Cut Into Chunks)
* Salt And Pepper
* 1 whole Medium Onion, Diced
* 3 cloves Garlic, Minced
* 4 ounces, weight Tomato Paste
* 3 cups Low Sodium Beef Stock Or Broth, More If Needed For Thinning
* Several Dashes Worcestershire
* 1/2 teaspoon Sugar
* 4 whole Carrots, Peeled And Diced
* 4 stalks of celery, diced
* 2 Tablespoons Minced Fresh Parsley
* 1 cup red wine
* Mashed potatoes

# Directions
* Salt and pepper stew meat. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add butter, and as soon as it melts, brown half the stew meat until the outside gets nice and brown, about 2 minutes. (Turn it as it browns.) Remove the meat from the pot with a slotted spoon and put it on a plate. Add the rest of the meat to the pot and brown it, too. Remove it to the same plate. Set the meat aside.
* Deglaze the pot with red wine then add the onion and garlic, stirring it to coat it in all the brown bits in the bottom of the pot. Cook for two minutes, then add the tomato paste to the pot. Stir it into the onions and let it cook for two more minutes.
* Pour in the beef stock & red wine, stirring constantly. Add the Worcestershire and sugar. Add the beef back to the pot, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.
* After 1 1/2 to 2 hours, add the celery and carrots to the pot. Stir to combine, put the lid back on the pot, and let it simmer for another 30 minutes. The sauce should be very thick, but if it seems overly so, splash in some beef broth until it thins it up enough. Feel free to add beef broth as needed!
* When the carrots and celery are tender, stir in minced parsley. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve piping hot in a bowl with mashed potatoes, letting the juice run all over everything. Sprinkle with extra minced parsley at the end.
