## Ingredients
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 10 oz spinach
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 3/4 cup ricotta cheese
* 1/4 tsp salt
* Pasta dough

# Directions
* Heat olive oil on medium heat, add spinach and cook covered, stirring occasionally, until spinach wilted, about 15 minutes.
* Cook for 5 or 10 more minutes uncovered until all liquid evaporates.
* Chop cooked spinach finely and move to a bowl.   Add Parmesan cheese and ricotta cheese, salt to taste and mix well.  Add more salt if necessary.
* Divide the ravioli dough (instructions on how to make ravioli dough from scratch are above) into 2 equal halves and roll each half into a very thin sheet with a rolling pin.  Make sure to have flour on hand and dust the working surface or rolling pan when necessary, because the dough will be sticky. It’s important that the ravioli dough be rolled very thinly (paper-thin), otherwise ravioli will be too solid when cooked, because dough expands during cooking. Also it will be really hard to use the ravioli mold if the dough is not thin enough.
* Once you rolled sheets of dough, shape individual raviolis.
* When you are done shaping ravioli, bring a big pot of water to boil, add ravioli and cook for 5 minutes, then drain. Or, alternatively, freeze ravioli until you’re ready to cook them.
