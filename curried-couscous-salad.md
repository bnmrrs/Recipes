## Ingredients
* 2 cups uncooked couscous (you can also use whole wheat couscous)
* ¾ cup finely shredded carrot
* ¾ cup finely chopped celery
* 3 green onions, finely sliced
* ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1 cup canned drained garbanzo beans
* ½ cup raisins or dried currants

## Dressing Ingredients:
* ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoon curry powder
* 1 tablespoon turmeric powder
* 1 tablespoon vegetable broth powder
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

# Directions
* To prepare the couscous, bring 2 cups of water along with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil to a boil in a medium saucepan. As soon as it’s boiling, add the couscous, immediately turn off the heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork and put it in a very large mixing bowl. Set
* Add all the veggies to the couscous and stir to combine.
* To prepare the dressing, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk until emulsified.
* Pour the dressing over the couscous salad, ⅓ at a time, stirring to combine between additions. Cover and refrigerate overnight so the flavors have time to meld. Because of the vinegar/acid content, use a glass or plastic bowl.
* Serve as a light lunch or as a side dish along with chicken, fish, etc.
