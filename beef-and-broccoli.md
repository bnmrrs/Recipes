## Ingredients - marinade
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 tbsp water
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 lbs flank steak, sliced into thin strips

## Ingredients - sauce
* 1/2 c low-sodium soy sauce (Do NOT use regular. The final product will be way too salty)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1 tbsp sherry
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 heads broccoli, crowns only

# Directions
* Whisk together the baking soda, sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, water, and vegetable oil in a large bowl. Toss the steak with the marinade to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, then proceed below
* In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, flour and sherry until smooth. Set aside.
* In a large wok or saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil over high heat until shimmering. Add broccoli and saute 3 minutes, stirring often. Transfer broccoli to a plate
* Reduce heat to medium-high. Carefully add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the hot pan. Add the marinated meat and half of the sauce mixture and saute for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until the meat is cooked through and no longer pink. Stir in the broccoli and remaining sauce. Saute 1 minute more. Serve
