# Buffalo Chicken Corn Chowder
http://blog.hostthetoast.com/buffalo-chicken-corn-chowder/

## Ingredients
* 5 slices bacon, chopped
* 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* 1/2 cup Frank’s hot sauce, divided
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 2 carrots, diced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 cups frozen corn
* 1 potato, peeled and diced small
* 2 cups cream
* 2.5 cups chicken stock
* Salt and pepper, taste
* Chopped green onions, for topping

# Directions
* Heat a medium-sized pot over medium heat and cook the bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pot and set it on a paper towel lined plate to drain.
* Drain half of the bacon fat, raise the heat to medium-high, and sear the chicken on all sides.
* Pour in 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce and cook the chicken until it has absorbed most of the sauce. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside.
* Add the onions, celery, and carrots to the pot and saute until the onions are almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped potato and saute another 5 minutes. Add the garlic, paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper and saute until the garlic becomes fragrant, about one more minute.
* Add the corn to the pot and mix it well with the other ingredients. Cook for 5 more minutes. Add the chicken broth and cream and let warm. Slowly add in the hot sauce, mixing well, and taste testing as you add. Remember, it’s best to start with less and add more if necessary than to add too much right away and then have to try to cut the spice. When the mixture is slightly less spicy than you’d like (it will become spicier as it cooks), turn the mixture to a low simmer and cook for 20 minutes.
* Ladle half of the soup into a blender or food processor and puree until creamy (or you can use an immersion blender). Pour the creamy soup back into the pot with the rest and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
* Put the chicken back into the pot and cook for another 5 – 10 minutes to heat the chicken back up.
* Top the chowder with the bacon crumbles, fresh cilantro, chopped green onions and serve.
