## Ingredients
* 4 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin intact
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* ⅓ cup all purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1.5 lbs tomatoes (I like using various sizes and colors of tomato)
* 1 small red bell pepper, sliced
* 1 small orange bell pepper, sliced
* ⅔ cup chicken stock
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* ½ teaspoon dried parsley
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
* ¼ teaspoon dried basil
* 10 pearl onions, peeled
* 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ½ teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon brined capers, drained
* ¼ cup fresh basil
* Pasta and bread, to serve

# Directions
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
* Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour and shake off the excess. Set aside.
* Heat the butter and olive oil in an oven-safe skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken all over and then remove to a plate.
* In a blender, combine half of the tomatoes, half of the peppers, the chicken stock, the tomato paste, the balsamic vinegar, and the dried herbs. Pulse until smooth.
* Add the garlic and the pearl onions to the pan. Saute for a minute. Add in the remaining peppers and tomatoes. Saute for an additional minute. Pour in the tomato broth mixture and stir in the sugar and capers. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil.
* Reduce to a simmer and add the chicken back to the pan, placing it on top of the tomatoes, peppers, and onions so that it is only partially submerged in the broth. Cook for an additional minute and then transfer to the oven, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through and sauce has reduced, about 45 minutes-1 hour.
* Mix in fresh basil and serve with pasta and bread.
