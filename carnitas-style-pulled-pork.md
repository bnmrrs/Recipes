# Carnitas Style Pulled Pork
http://nwtablescraps.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/slow-cooked-carnitas-style-pork-tacos/

## Ingredients
* 2lb. pork shoulder (also called “pork butt”)
* 1 small onion
* 1/2 a large orange
* 1 lime
* 1 Serrano pepper
* 3-4 cloves garlic
* 2 Tbsp. fresh cilantro
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil

# Directions
* Cut the pork shoulder into large chunks
* Put them into a baking dish that is just large enough to fit them all. With the meat taking up most or all of the baking dish, the fat will render out and cook the pork confit style. This will result in extremely moist and tender meat after a few hours in the oven.
* Squeeze the juice out of the orange and lime, then roughly chop the onion, garlic, and Serrano pepper. Throw it all in a blender or food processor with a big pinch of salt. I use a miniature blender for this amount, but use whatever you have.
* Blend everything up until its relatively smooth.
* Then add it to the pork and sprinkle on the ground cumin.
* Lastly, pour in the vegetable oil. All that’s left to do is mix it all together, cover tightly with foil, and stick in a 275 degree oven.
* Start checking it after 2 hours, but it may take closer to 3. It’s done when a fork easily shreds off a piece with very little effort. 
* Put a strainer over a bowl and pour in the pork and its liquid, letting it drain for 5 minutes or so.
* Throw it back on the baking sheet…
* and shred it up using forks, tongs, or your fingers! Since you won’t be able to resist anyway, give it a taste. I know, I know…its freaking delicious already. Add in some more salt to taste. Bonus: you can make the pork to this point up to 2-3 days ahead of time, refrigerate it, and then move on to the next step when you’re ready.
* Back at the bowl, you should have a little separation happening between the fat and the marinade. Use a small spoon to skim off some of the fat and drizzle it back onto the pork. This will help it get really nice and crispy when we broil
* Place the pork under the broiler until it's crispy
