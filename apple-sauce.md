# Apple Sauce
http://chefmichaelsmith.com/recipe/cinnamon-applesauce

## Ingredients
* 1 dozen or so of your favourite apples
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 heaping Tablespoon ground cinnamon
* a dash pure vanilla extract
* a dash salt
* a splash water

# Directions
* Remove the cores from the apples, and—leaving the skins on—cut them into several large chunks.
* Toss into a pot and add the brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and salt. Add a splash of water, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot, and place over a medium-high heat.
* Cover with a tight-fitting lid. In a few minutes the water will begin to steam, and the heat will encourage the apples to soften and release their own moisture.
* Keep an eye on the pot and stir frequently so they don’t stick to the bottom. Cook until all the apples are softened and the mixture simmers, about 20 minutes in total.
* Blend with an immersion blender.
