## Ingredients
* 1½ pounds medium red or Yukon Gold potatoes (3 or 4)
* ½ cup low-fat milk
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter or e.v. olive oil
* 4 whole sprigs thyme
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon e.v. olive oil

# Directions
* Scrub the potatoes if you are not peeling them. The potato skins are thin and edible so peel only if you wish. Then cut potatoes in half. Place them in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to medium and simmer (low boil) until the potatoes are very tender and can be easily pierced with the tip of a paring knife, 18 to 22 minutes. 
* Meanwhile, wash the 4 sprigs thyme, smash and peel 2 cloves garlic, cut off 3T. of butter and unwrap. 
* Add to a small saucepan with 1/2 c. milk and 1 tsp. salt. Bring to a boil then turn off the heat and let sit until the potatoes are ready. Are the potatoes tender, yet? Place a colander in the sink and drain the potatoes. Return them to the same saucepan. 
* Mash the potatoes with a handheld masher. Using tongs, pluck the thyme and garlic from the milk mixture and discard. Then, pour all of milk mixture over the potatoes and continue to mash and stir until creamy. You can add a little more milk, if you like, for a creamier consistency. Serve topped with a 1T. drizzle of olive oil and the 1/8 tsp. pepper (6 turns on pepper mill).
