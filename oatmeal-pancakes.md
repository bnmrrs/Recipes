## Ingredients
* 1 cup (123g) whole wheat flour (or white whole-wheat)
* 1/2 cup (40g) quick oats
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 large egg (or 2 egg whites)
* 1 cup (240ml) milk*
* 2 Tablespoons dark brown sugar (or light brown)
* 1/4 cup (63g) Greek yogurt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup add-ins like chocolate chips or fruit, optional

# Directions
* Toss the flour, oats, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Set aside. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the egg and milk together. Whisk in the brown sugar and yogurt until no lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla until combined.
* Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients in. Stir gently until just combined. Do not overmix the batter or your pancakes will be tough and very dense. Add any mix-ins you prefer, but again - do not overmix the batter.
* Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Coat generously with cooking spray, oil, or butter.  Once hot, drop about 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle. Cook until the edges look dry and bubbles begin to form on the center or sides, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side until cooked through, about 2 more minutes. Coat griddle/skillet again with nonstick spray for each pancake or batch of pancakes.
* Keep pancakes warm in a preheated 200F degree oven until all pancakes are cooked. Serve immediately. Pancakes taste best right after they are made. Pancakes freeze well, up to 2 months.
