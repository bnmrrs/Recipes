# Mexican Quinoa Bake
http://www.amuse-your-bouche.com/mexican-quinoa-bake/

## Ingredients
* 175g quinoa
* 500ml vegetable stock (plus extra water if needed)
* 1 tbsp oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 red pepper, diced
* 3 spring onions, sliced
* 100g sweetcorn kernels
* 1 x 400g tin black beans, drained and rinsed (240g when drained)
* 4tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
* 250g red enchilada sauce (shop-bought or homemade)
* ½ tsp smoked paprika
* ½ tsp hot chilli powder
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 100g grated cheese (I used a mozzarella and cheddar mix)

# Directions
* Preheat the oven to 375°F
* Boil the quinoa in the vegetable stock for around 15 minutes - the quinoa should become soft and the spiral-shaped germ should detach, and the liquid should all be absorbed. If the liquid begins to dry up before the quinoa is ready, just add a dash more water and mix well. When the liquid is nearly gone, you will need to turn the heat down fairly low to prevent the quinoa from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
* While the quinoa is cooking, heat the oil in a large frying pan, and add the garlic, onion and red pepper. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are almost soft. Remove from the heat, and add the spring onions, sweetcorn, drained black beans and fresh coriander. Stir in the enchilada sauce and the cooked quinoa, and then add the spices as necessary (if your sauce was particularly spicy you might decide to skip the additional chilli powder). Season to taste, and mix well to combine.
* Transfer the mixture to a large baking dish, and sprinkle over the grated cheese. Bake for around 30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and crispy, and the quinoa mixture is piping hot.
