https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/fruit-recipes/soaked-pistachio-citrus-cake/

## Ingredients
* 75 g unsalted butter , plus extra for greasing
* 4 large free-range eggs
* 100 g sugar
* 100 g ground pistachios
* 100 g fine semolina
* 1 lemon
* 50 g no-peel orange marmalade
* 1 teaspoon dried mint
* 25 g pistachios
* 2 lemons
* 150 g sugar


# Directions
* Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm round loose-bottomed cake tin.
* Melt the butter over a low heat, then set aside.
* Separate the egg yolks and whites. Beat the egg yolks with the sugar in an electric mixer until light and creamy.
* While the machine is running, slowly add the pistachios and semolina, followed by the melted butter, lemon zest, marmalade and ¼ teaspoon of sea salt. Beat until smooth.
* In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
* Gently fold this into the pistachio mixture in three additions in order to keep it as airy as possible.
* Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and an inserted wooden skewer comes out clean.
* Meanwhile, make the lemon syrup. Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a saucepan and stir over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside.
* Pierce the cake all over with a skewer as soon as you remove it from the oven. Slowly pour the syrup over the cake while it’s still warm.
* Sprinkle with the dried mint, then chop and scatter over the pistachios.
* Leave the cake to cool completely before removing from the tin. Serve slices with a spoonful of Greek yoghurt, if you like.
