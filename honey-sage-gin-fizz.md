## Ingredients
*  3 ounces gin
* 1/2 â€“ 1 ounce honey sage syrup, depending on your desired level of sweetness (recipe below)
* 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice
* 5 ounces club soda
* fresh sage leaves for garnish

## Directions
* Fill the glass with a few sage leaves and ice cubes, then add gin, 1/2 ounce of syrup and lime juice, stirring well. 
* Pour in club soda, stirring a bit more, then taste and determine if the drink has enough sweetness. If not, add a bit more.
* Garnish with an extra sage leaf and serve. Enjoy!

## Honey sage syrup
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/2 cup water
* 5-6 fresh sage leaves

## Directions
* Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and stir until it appears that all of the honey has dissolved. Remove from heat and let sit until completely cooled to room temperature. Remove sage leaves before using. This can be made well ahead of time and store in a jar in the fridge.
